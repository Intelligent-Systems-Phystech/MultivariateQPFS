abstract="The growth of the area of inverse problems within applied mathematics in recent years has been driven both by the needs of applications and by advances in a rigorous convergence theory of regularization methods for the solution of nonlinear ill-posed problems. There are at least two widely used approaches for solving inverse problems in a stable way: Tikhonov regularization and iterative regularization techniques. In this paper we give an overview over the latter. Moreover, we put the analysis of iterative methods for the solution of ill-posed problems into perspective with the analysis of iterative methods for the solution of well-posed problems.",
